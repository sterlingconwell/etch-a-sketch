# Etch-A-Sketch

A web-based recreation of the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy. This digital implementation allows users to draw by hovering over a grid, creating pixel art-style drawings. The project features controls to clear the screen, change the grid size, and modify the drawing color, simulating the nostalgic experience of the iconic red-framed mechanical drawing toy.
